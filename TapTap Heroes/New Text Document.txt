I hope everyone completed Basic Concepts. It includes

1. What's Python?
high level programming language

2. Hello World! Program
print("Hello World!)
print('Hi')
NOTE- the print statement gives the user multiple lines of output.
We can use both '...' and "..." inside ().
print("Ko Ko said, \" I'm hungry \")
print(' Ko Ko said, "You\'re Welcome". ')
NOTE- But we need to use \' to print ' inside '...'
Similarly \" inside "..." to print "

3. VALUE TYPES
Most common types are int(integer e.g. 10), str (string, e.g. Hello) & float (floating point e.g. 3.142)
print(15)
print("15")
NOTE-both lines are correct.
15 means 15 is integer.
"15" means 15 is string.
print(Hi)
NOTE-this is wrong because Hi cannot be integer. We need either ' ' or " "

4. ASSIGNING
Hi=5
print(Hi)
print
NOTE- This is correct because

OPERATIONS

NOTE- Minus(-) is unary operator as well as binary operator in Python.
